## Helper scripts

`commit.bat` is a convenience script for Windows users. It adds all files,
creates a commit and pushes to the `main` branch. Run it from anywhere, or pass
an optional commit message:

```bat
commit.bat "My commit message"
```

The script uses relative paths so it works as long as it resides inside the
repository.
